This is a set of matlab codes to compare statistical tools on
Riemannian Manifold and on groups.

Original Developer: Nina Miolane (original codes in Scilab)
Scilab to Matlab conversion: Nina Miolane, Bishesh Khanal

Dependencies:
Almost all of the codes should work with a basic version of matlab.
However, to use real brain data one needs the following softwares/toolboxes
installed.
1. spm to extract surface from the brain volume.
2. toolbox_graph to plot the brain surface mesh obtained from spm.
With this tool many different meshes are plotted in the same coordinate frame.
