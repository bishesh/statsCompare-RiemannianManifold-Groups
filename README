This is a set of matlab codes to compare the computing of the different types of means
on Lie groups. These codes can be used to reproduce the experiments illustrated in the
video developed for the MICCAI Educational challenge 2014, available at:
url of the video.


Dependencies:
If you use the brain.mat file available then matlab along with the following toolboxes
should be availble:
1. toolbox_graph to plot the brain surface mesh. Available at:
http://www.mathworks.co.uk/matlabcentral/fileexchange/5355-toolbox-graph

If you want to create the brain surface and convert it to the matlab readable mesh from
a skull stripped brain MRI volume then you need following additional softwares.
1. SPM (these codes use spm8) available at:
